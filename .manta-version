# Manta Library Version Lock File
#
# This file specifies which version of the dotabuff/manta library to use
# when building python-manta wheels.
#
# Version Synchronization Strategy:
# - python-manta version should match upstream manta version
# - Example: If this file says "v1.4.5", then pyproject.toml should be "1.4.5"
#
# Valid values:
# - master          : Latest development (for dev builds)
# - v1.4.5          : Specific release tag (for stable releases)
# - commit-hash     : Specific commit (for testing)
#
# How to upgrade:
# 1. Check latest manta version: https://github.com/dotabuff/manta/releases
# 2. Update this file with the new version tag (e.g., v1.4.6)
# 3. Update pyproject.toml version to match (1.4.6)
# 4. Build and test: ./build.sh
# 5. Create release tag: git tag v1.4.6
#
# Current manta version:
v1.4.5
